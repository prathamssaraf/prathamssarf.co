# Contact Form Setup Instructions

Your contact form has been updated to work with Formspree, a simple service that sends form submissions directly to your email without any complex setup.

## What's Been Implemented

✅ **Contact Form Updates:**
- Added form validation (all fields are now required)
- Added visual feedback for success/error messages
- Added loading state when sending messages
- Made "Contact Me" button scroll smoothly to the contact form
- Added Formspree integration for sending emails directly to your Gmail

## ✨ Ready to Use - No Additional Setup Required!

Your contact form is **already configured** to send emails to `prathamssaraf@gmail.com` using Formspree.

### How It Works

1. **User fills out the form** on your website
2. **Form submits to Formspree** (a free service)
3. **Formspree sends the message** directly to your Gmail inbox
4. **You receive the email** with all the form details

### First Use Setup (One-time only)

The **first time** someone submits your contact form:
1. Formspree will send you a **confirmation email**
2. **Click the confirmation link** in that email
3. After confirmation, all future messages will be delivered automatically

That's it! No accounts to create, no API keys to manage.

## Testing the Form

After completing the setup:
1. Open your website in a browser
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Click "Send Message"
4. You should see a success message and receive an email

## Features

- **Form Validation**: All fields are required before submission
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages with appropriate styling
- **Loading State**: Button shows "Sending..." while processing
- **Email Fallback**: If EmailJS fails, users see your direct email address
- **Smooth Scrolling**: "Contact Me" button scrolls to the form
- **Form Reset**: Form clears after successful submission

## Troubleshooting

- **Form not sending**: Check your EmailJS credentials in `js/main.js`
- **No success/error message**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Emails not received**: Verify your EmailJS service and template configuration
- **Styling issues**: Check that Bootstrap CSS is loading properly

## Free Tier Limits

EmailJS free tier allows:
- 200 emails per month
- 2 email services
- 1 email template

This should be sufficient for a personal portfolio website.
