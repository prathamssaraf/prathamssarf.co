Your contact form is **fully functional** and sends emails to `prathamssaraf@gmail.com` using the visitor's default email client.

### How It Works

1. **User fills out the form** on your website
2. **Clicks "Send Message"** 
3. **Their email client opens** (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.) with your email pre-filled
4. **They click send** in their email app
5. **You receive the email** directly in your Gmail inbox

### Benefits of This Approach

## Testing the Form

After completing the setup:
1. Open your website in a browser
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Click "Send Message"
4. You should see a success message and receive an email

## Features

- **Form Validation**: All fields are required before submission
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages with appropriate styling
- **Loading State**: Button shows "Sending..." while processing
- **Email Fallback**: If EmailJS fails, users see your direct email address

## Troubleshooting

- **Form not sending**: Check your EmailJS credentials in `js/main.js`
